# 🤔 What's this?

This repository contains little applications of C++, these are just simple examples that are used to learn the features of the language.

# ⚡️ Get started with C++

> NOTE: This guide assumes you are using Mac OS.

Make sure you have g++ istalled by typing 

```
g++ --version
```

Once you wrote some C++ code you need to compile it like so:

```
g++ ./<file_name.cpp> -o <executable_file_name>
```

Example:

```
g++ ./hello_world.cpp -o hello_world
```

This will create an executable file that you can run by running:

```
./hello_world
```
